An ActionScript3.0 binary decision tree in ActionScript 3.0 for AI bot/agent in a video games

This just contain a base class for each decision node, action node, and the tree. So you must create a working concrete class by extending them.

Decision node is a node which have children node or branch. 
Action node is a node which didn't have children node, but have an action/behaviour to take.
FSMAction node is a special Action node designed for a FSM-Decision Tree hybrid. So you can just use this class by defining the FSM entity and its target state. No need to extends this class and defining its behaviour/action. Note: its depend on my FSM class.
